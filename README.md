# RealEstateVision
RealEstateVision is state-of-the-art real estate application on which I am working as my portfolio project. Initially it is built using OOP concepts and basic functionalities have been implemented like various property types and relevant types of dealings being offered by real estate agents.
I am working to engineer a full fledge large scale, enterprise system backed by AI/ML intelligence.
